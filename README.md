# POKéMON Directory App (Pokédex)

# How to setup
Follow the steps below to clone a project, install necessary packages, and run the app locally.

## 1. Clone the Project

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

- Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal you use).
- Use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository.

## 2. Install Package 
After cloning the project, you need to install the required dependencies using `npm`.
```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Run the App
Now that all dependencies are installed, and since this app is an Ionic app, you can run the app using the following command:
```bash
ionic serve
```
This will start the development server and open the app in your browser. The server usually runs on `http://localhost:8100/` by default.

Additional notes:
- nodejs version used 22.13.0
- If you don't have Ionic installed, you can install it globally using npm:
```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```
- To stop the development server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
